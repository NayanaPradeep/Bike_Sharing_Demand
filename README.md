# Bike Sharing Demand Analysis

# Problem Statement

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

# Data Description

The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.

* ### Date : year-month-day
* ### Rented Bike count - Count of bikes rented at each hour
* ### Hour - Hour of he day
* ### Temperature-Temperature in Celsius
* ### Humidity - %
* ### Windspeed - m/s
* ### Visibility - 10m
* ### Dew point temperature - Celsius
* ### Solar radiation - MJ/m2
* ### Rainfall - mm
* ### Snowfall - cm
* ### Seasons - Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn
* ### Holiday - Holiday/No holiday
* ### Functional Day - NoFunc(Non Functional Hours), Fun(Functional hours)

# Conclusion

* Developed multiple regression models to predict the number of bikes rented every hour 
* Performed Data Visualization, Label Encoding and Data Transformation to understand, analyze and process the data. 
* Used Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Random Forest models and performed Hyperparameter tuning on XGBoost and Random Forest models 
* XGBoost Model with hyperparameter tuning performed the best with the R2 score of 93.66%
